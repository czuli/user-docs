# Snyk Buddy integration


The Snyk Buddy integration allows you to stay ahead of security concerns by helping you find and fix vulnerabilities in your appâ€™s project dependencies.

The integration lets you:

* scan your project's dependencies and check for any known vulnerabilities
* continuously monitor your project dependencies and send alerts if any security issues or vulnerabilities are discovered
* maintain high code quality and security
* receive detailed security reports that highlight the vulnerabilities found in your dependencies

## How to set up a Buddy integration

1.Go to the [Account Settings](https://app.snyk.io/account) in Snyk, open the **General** tab, and copy the key displayed there:

Once the integration is configured, you can add the **Snyk** action to your pipeline in Buddy to ensure that the security of your application is continuously monitored:

The default command in the action is ``snyk test``,which can be easily expanded with other [Snyk CLI commands](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/cli-commands-and-options-summary):

You can view scan results in the pipeline logs. The commands are color-coded for easier issue identification:
